//! The seller node's durable lifecycle state: `$MOBEE_HOME/seller.sqlite`.
//!
//! Opened only by the node (single-owner, guaranteed by the home lock). This SQLite database — in
//! WAL mode, `synchronous=FULL`, foreign keys on — is the **source of truth** for the seller's
//! trade lifecycle: the offers it has seen, the claims it has parked, the awards it has been
//! selected for, the jobs it is running, its deliveries and its collected receipts. Alongside them
//! sits the **nostr event outbox**: every event the node publishes is written to the DB and
//! enqueued in the SAME transaction as the state change that produced it, then handed to an async
//! publisher that retries until the relay confirms it or it expires. A crash between "state
//! changed" and "event sent" therefore never loses the obligation to publish, and never publishes
//! twice — the outbox `dedup_key` makes re-enqueue a no-op and the stored `created_at` makes the
//! signed event's id deterministic, so a re-publish is relay-idempotent.
//!
//! Every transition here is idempotent: replaying an award, a delivery, or a receipt lands the same
//! state and never double-credits. `rusqlite`'s [`Connection`] is `Send` but not `Sync`, so the
//! store keeps it behind a mutex and callers reach it from the async runtime via `spawn_blocking`.
